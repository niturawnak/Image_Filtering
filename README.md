# Image_Filtering
The goal of this task is to implement different multilateral filters and upsampling algorithms using guided filtering and finally to compare upsampled depth images with corresponding ground truth images.<br/>
The implemented algorithms are:

* Bilateral(B) filter
* Joint Bilateral(JB) filtering
* Joint Bilateral Upsampling(JBU)
* JIterative upsampling

The algorithms can be run using the following command:
```
./HelloWorld_Exec Image1 Image2 output window_size spatial_sigma range_sigma
```
The other python files can be run independently using Visual Studio or any other IDE.
